# A simple javascript pokertimer

Written with all sorts of 2011 era goodness.

Games are stored in HTML5 localStorage, with the option to share the game to the server. When a game is shared it is shown on the front screen and anyone can use the timer and add a break or time to a game.

The timer requires a modern web browser, you can just open the HTML file in a web browser to use the timer. Saving the games to localStorage requires a simple web server, synchronization requires a server running PHP.
